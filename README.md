# Raspberry Pi Feed to Cloud

Connecting a camera to a Raspberry Pi through the on-board camera port or USB port can assist in capturing images or videos. This setup can serve various purposes. In this repository, you can find a prebuilt shell script designed to facilitate continuous image streaming to online cloud services such as Google Drive for Linux-operated Raspberry Pi.

## ðŸ“‹ Use cases

- Online Stream of Camera
- Frame Capture for Time-lapse

## ðŸ”§ How to use

First of all, you should install dependencies like 'ffmpeg', 'rclone'. To do it use the command below:  

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg rclone
```

After that, you should configure your cloud service, which here we continue with the Google Drive option.
I suggest to use this two complete tutorials for proper configuration:  

- [Google Drive by rclone on Bealdung](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/google-drive-guide#2-rclone)
- [Official rclone Google Drive Document](https://rclone.org/drive/)

But simply to do that start with rclone, you should use the command below and follow the given instructions:  

```bash
rclone config
```

Now, You should have a directory on your local device to sync Google Drive with it. Here we create a directory named `/home/user/path/to/`, to do this you can use this command:

```bash
mkdir /home/user/path/to
```

So, Time to **configure a webcam or camera**. Here I'm using a USB webcam but if you want to use the on-board Raspberry Pi camera follow [this link](https://www.codeinsideout.com/blog/pi/set-up-camera/#record-h264-video).  

![USB webcam connected to Raspberry Pi 4](/assets/images/webcam-to-rp4.png "USB webcam connected to Pi 4")

Connect the USB webcam to Raspberry Pi and find the hardware directory which in this example is `/dev/video0`.

Awesome, All essential parts are configured. Now the script is ready for use.  
Download the script file to your local machine:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosnfar/raspberrypi4-camera-to-cloud/main/run.sh -o ./run.sh
```

Before using the script you should change some variables in the script to work correctly. Use `nano run.sh` to open text editor then go to 'Configure global variables' section and change the variable.

```bash
...

# Configure global variables

DRIVE_ADD="drive:/parentfolder/subfolder" #rclone given address for drive main folder and subfolder

STORE_DIR="/home/user/path/to/" #Local directory which will link to drive
LOG_DIR="/home/user/path/for/log/" #Directory to store log for command

CAMERA_ADD="/dev/video0" #Hardware directory for Video Input

DAY_OF_STORAGE=2 #Maximum date for storage - e.g. 2 days
MAX_STORAGE_SIZE=200000000 #Maximum size for storage - e.g. 200000000 Byte -> 200 MB

INTERVAL_DELAY=10 #Interval between taking frames - e.g. 10 seconds

MAX_RETRIES=10 #Times to rclone try

...
```

You should change these variables:

**Essential Variables**

Should change this before running this script according to your configuration.  

- **DRIVE_ADD**: The address to which you configure Google Drive with rclone command.
- **STORE_DIR**: This directory will be connected to Drive and sync with it.
- **LOG_DIR**: Where you want to store your system script logs and errors.
- **CAMERA_ADD**: Hardware address of video input (webcam|camera) to use.
- **DAY_OF_STORAGE**: By this variable, you can configure how many days should store the content.
- **MAX_STORAGE_SIZE**: This variable is used to manage Drive capacity and prevent extending from Google storage limit.
- **INTERVAL_DELAY**: This is the gap time between taking frames.

**Additional Variables**

If you customize the script more, you can change this too.

- **MAX_RETRIES**: This variable defines how many times should rclone try.  

Now everything is done and you should add `run.sh` command to system jobs to be run on every reboot. To do that use this command:

```bash
sudo chmod +x run.sh && (crontab -l ; echo "@reboot /real/path/to/run.sh") | crontab - && crontab -l
```

And its better to reboot your system.

ðŸŽ‰ It's Done. All is ready.
